## Overview

[BuildStatusBadge](https://devboldly.github.io/react-build-status-badge/BuildStatusBadge) is a React component that allows you to put a real-time build status badge on your site.

The badge automatically updates as the status changes‚Äîno clearing the cache or refreshing the page required.

Just paste in your status badge Markdown and you're ready to go. Additional options are available.

### Features include:

- **üìú Supports Markdown links. Just paste and go.**
  - Use the Markdown link from your CI/CD service for dead simple setup.
- **üîÑ Automatic reloading for real-time status**
  - Badge reloads automatically so the status stays current. No page refresh required.
- **üê£ New badge every time using cache-busting**
  - Uses client-side cache-busting to prevent old, cached build status badges from being shown.

## Installation

```
npm i react-build-status-badge
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import { BuildStatusBadge } from 'react-build-status-badge';
```

The easiest way is to simply paste in your badge Markdown image link, like so:

```jsx
<BuildStatusBadge>
  [![Deploy Status](https://github.com/devboldly/react-build-status-badge/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/devboldly/react-build-status-badge/actions?query=workflow%3ADeploy)
</BuildStatusBadge>
```

See the [BuildStatusBadge docs](https://devboldly.github.io/react-build-status-badge/BuildStatusBadge) for additional methods and options.
